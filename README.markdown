Bunto is a Web Application Framework and can be used as a static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Bunto takes your content, renders HTML and CSS templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, hostSE, Nginx or another web server. Bunto is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.
